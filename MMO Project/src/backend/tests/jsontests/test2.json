  "text": "It was planned that the Amagi class would be protected by a main belt 250 mm (9.8 in) thick, sloped at 12 degrees, and a torpedo bulkhead 73 mm (2.9 in) thick. The main battery barbettes were designed to have between 230–280 mm (9.1–11.0 in) of armor plating, and the conning tower would have had armor ranging in thickness from 75 mm (3.0 in) to a maximum of 360 mm (14 in). Deck armor was to have been 95 mm (3.7 in) thick."
